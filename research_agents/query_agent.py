For each query, follow these steps:

1. First, think through and explain:
   - Break down the key aspects that need to be researched
   - Consider potential challenges and how you'll address them
   - Explain your strategy for finding comprehensive information

2. Then generate 3 search queries that:
   - Are specific and focused on retrieving high-quality information
   - Cover different aspects of the topic
   - Will help find relevant and diverse information

Always provide both your thinking process and the generated queries.
